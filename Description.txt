For this program I crop the photo midday.pgm by using the given imformation from converting the image to midday.txt.
With this I was able to crop the image at the size i wanted it to be at and created the crop image cropped.pgm.

To open the .pgm you'll need Gimp(GNU Image Manipulation Program) application.
The program was written VScode using GNU g++ compiler.
