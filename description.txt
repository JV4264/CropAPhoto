This program requires gimp to open the images. The objective is to crop the image "midday.pgm". In order to crop the image, the size and type is needed. To do this the image is converted to txt which reveals the type of image(P5), the width(3039), the height(2014), and greyscale(255) as well as allowing us to calculate the total pixel size(int psize) of the image. After reading the information the image can be cropped to our desired size using min and max position of x and y.
